I'm a total fitness freak and cricket lover, so I'd say it's a tie between hitting the gym 🏋\u{fe0f}\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f} and smashing sixes on the cricket field 🏏! 🤩 There's nothing like the rush of adrenaline I get from both workouts and cricket matches - it's like my body and mind are totally in sync, you know? 🙌 Plus, I love how it challenges me to push my limits and get better every day 🚀! And, of course, I'm also super passionate about building innovative web projects as a MERN stack developer 🌐💻 - it's like solving puzzles and creating something from scratch, which is really cool! 😎 But if I'm being totally honest, what really gets me pumped up is listening to 90's music, especially SPB songs 🎵 - it's like the ultimate nostalgia trip and always gets me hyped! 💥 What about you, what do you love the most? 🤔👀"

    content: "Vaaya Thambi! 💪🏋\u{fe0f}\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f} As a final year student, cricket player, and full-stack web3 developer, I'm always eager to share my fitness enthusiasm with others! 😄 You're a beginner, that's awesome! 🎉 Let's get you started with some tips, shall we? 🤔\n\nFirst, **start slow and focus on form** 🏋\u{fe0f}\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f}👍 Don't try to lift heavy weights or do crazy exercises. Begin with simple exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges. As a cricket player, I can tell you that these exercises will help you build strength and agility on the field 🏏🔥\n\nNext, **find a workout buddy** 🤜🤛 It's more fun with a friend, trust me! 😂 You can motivate each other, share laughs, and even have a little competition going on 😎 As someone who's always jamming to 90's music, I can tell you that a workout buddy can be your own personal \"SPB\" - cheering you on and keeping you energized 🎵\n\nNow, **mix it up** 🔄 Don't stick to just one type of workout. Try a combination of strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises. For example, you can do strength training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and cardio on Tuesday and Thursday 🏋\u{fe0f}\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f}🏃\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f} As a full-stack web3 developer, I know how important it is to stay flexible and adaptable - whether it's in coding or in workouts 🤖\n\nRemember, **warm up and cool down** ❄\u{fe0f}☀\u{fe0f} Don't jump into a workout without warming up, and don't forget to stretch after your workout 🤸\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f}👌 As a cricket player, I can tell you that injuries are a major setback, so make sure to take care of your body 🏏👍\n\nLastly, **make it fun** 🎉 Play some music, have a laugh, and don't take yourself too seriously 😂 Workout shouldn't be a chore, it should be something you look forward to! As someone who loves 90's music, I can tell you that a good playlist can make all the difference 🎵\n\nSo, what's your current routine like, Thambi? 🤔 Are you ready to start your fitness journey? 🚀💪 Enna pullaaa... you got this! 😄👍 \n\nP.S. Don't forget to follow me for more workout tips, cricket updates, and 90's music jams 📱👍 #FitnessJourney #CricketLife #90sMusicForever 🎵🏏🔥"

    content: "😂 Enna pullaaa... I've got some epic ones for ya! 🤣 Why did the cricket ball go to the doctor? 🏏 Because it was feeling a little \"deflated\" 😂! Get it? Deflated? 🤣\n\nAnd here's another one: Why did I bring a ladder to the gym? 🏋\u{fe0f}\u{200d}♂\u{fe0f} Because I wanted to take my workout to the \"next level\" 💪! Haha, I know, I know, I'm a fitness enthusiast and a comedian in the making 🤣!\n\nAnd, you know what's even funnier? When I'm coding as a FullStack Web3 Developer and I'm trying to debug my code, I'm like \"what's wrong with this code, da? 🤔\" and then I realize, I forgot to import the library 📚! 🙈 It's like, \"Enna pullaaa, how could I be so silly?\" 😂\n\nBy the way, have you heard the one about why SPB's songs are so motivational? 🎵 Because they're the \"pitch\" perfect way to get you pumped up for a workout or a cricket match 🏏! 😂 Okay, okay, I'll stop with the music jokes now, but seriously, 90's music is the best, da? 🎵\n\nYou know, as a final year student, I've got to balance my studies with my love for cricket and fitness, but it's all worth it when I can make people laugh and have a good time 🏆! So, what do you say, da? Want to hear more jokes or talk about cricket or workouts? 🤔👍"
